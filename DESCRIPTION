Description: A major challenge in estimating individualized treatment selection rules lies in detecting relatively small treatment effect modification-related variabilities (i.e., the treatment-by-covariates interaction effects on the treatment outcome) against a relatively large non-treatment-related variabilities (i.e., main effects of covariates on the treatment outcome). The class of constrained functional additive models (CFAM) is an additive model for a potentially large number of functional/scalar regressors and a treatment indicator, specifically designed to estimate components associated with the treatment effect modification-related variabilities of the regressors, while allowing for nonlinear associations with the treatment outcomes. CFAM provides a flexible regression approach to developing individualized treatment selection rules based on patients' data measured at baseline. For details, see “Constrained functional additive models for estimating interactions between a treatment and a large number of functional covariates” (Park, H., Petkova, E., Tarpey, T., Ogden, R.T., 2019). The main function of this package is cfam().
